The Hi-C data can be found in GSM2935613. AllValidPairs files can be used to build raw Hi-C contact matrix files (in sparse matrix format) at three resolutions: 10K resolution. KR (Knight-Ruiz) and MCFS (Median Contact Frequency Scaling) method has been used to implicitly correct the contact matrix. Then we use HiC-Pro convert sparse matrix to dense matrix.

## Usage:   
Run the following commands in order
1. "HiC_degValue.py"
