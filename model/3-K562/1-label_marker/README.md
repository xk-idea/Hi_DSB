The K562.label.rar, the final K562 label in each chr, can be used as model label.

The DSB of K562 was measured using BLESS, Since the peaks of BLISS is not available from the GEO database, we need to operate peak-calling. Therefore, the raw data of BLISS are subjected to quality control. The effective reads of BLISS are screened and compared to the human hg19 genome version. Then peak-calling is performed using the software and parameters required in the respective articles. For BLISS, it is worth noting that after align to the reference genome (hg19), Since BLISS can be processed by using custom scripts, we execute the script of bliss_align.sh used in Tracy Ballinger et al (PMID: 30736820) to process BLISS data. By executing bliss_align.sh, we can obtain the final BED file containing unique UMIs (see the methods in our article).
